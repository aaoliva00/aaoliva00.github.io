        <p class="mb-4"><strong>I am Alex Oliva; I am a second-year student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and
                I am
                currently
                majoring computer science.</strong> After I earn my degree, I hope to get a job as a software
            programmer, or
            potentially start my own company.

            Some of my hobbies include watching and playing baseball, tinkering with computers, coding, fixing my car
            when it breaks, and hanging out with friends. Over the summer, I spent most of my time working as a software
            programmer for a small company in Minneapolis. The year before, I taught coding camps to kids over the
            summer.</p>
